Calculation Engine for CBIE System
Implements cluster-centric formulas from MVP documentation

METHOD USAGE STATUS:
  ✅ calculate_behavior_metrics() - USED for quality scoring (NOT for CORE detection)
  ✅ calculate_cluster_strength() - USED for LLM context filtering (NOT for CORE detection)
  ✅ _calculate_recency_factor() - USED in cluster_strength + stored as metadata (NOT for CORE detection)
  ✅ calculate_confidence_from_stability() - USED for LLM context filtering (NOT for CORE detection)
  ✅ calculate_cluster_confidence() - USED for metadata/analytics storage (NOT for CORE detection)
  ✅ select_canonical_label() - USED for UI display (NOT for CORE detection)

CORE BEHAVIOR DETECTION:
  ⚠️ NONE of the methods in this file are used for CORE vs non-CORE classification
  ⚠️ CORE detection uses ONLY: cluster_stability (HDBSCAN persistence from clustering_engine.py)
  ⚠️ Formula: stability >= median_stability AND stability >= 0.15 → CORE
  
NOTE: These methods calculate important metrics for:
  - LLM context selection (cluster_strength >= min_strength, confidence >= min_confidence)
  - Analytics and metadata storage (consistency_score, reinforcement_score, clarity_trend)
  - UI display (canonical_label, cluster_name)
